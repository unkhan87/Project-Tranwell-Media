# 1. UX

[Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

The application was developed to cater new startup digital marketing agency in order to increase their online visibility and to cater their client. My objective was to create a website that can offer simplicity and a user frienly appointment booking system to the user.

This project will showcase simplicity and ease to create an appointment, update an appointment and cancel an appointment to the user.

<a name="strategy"></a>

## 1.1. Strategy

[Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

### Project Goals
The main goal of this project is to allow the user to sign up, sign in/out, create/update a user appoitnments in a simple and effective process.

### User Goals:
First Time Visitor Goals
-   As a first-time visitor, I want to an appointment at my chosen date and time.
-   As a first-time visitor, I want to be able to get the contact details of the restaurant with ease.

Returning Visitor Goals
-   As a Returning Visitor, I want to update my appointment details.
-   As a Returning Visitor, I want to cancel a booking I have already made.


### User Expectations:
The system should have a simple user interface, with the navigation to each section clear and concise.

-   The menu is clear to read.
-   The user interface is easy to navigate.
-   The website is responsive on all devices.
-   To have the ability to contact the agency for any enquiries.

### User Stories
Throughout the project I used the GitHub projects board to log all user stories as my project management tool. This helped me keep focus on the necesarry tasks as I would move them to the "in progress lane" as I'm working on the story. I would then move them to the "done" lane once the story has been completed.

## Scope
As I am unable to include all of the features from the strategy table. I will phase this project in multiple phases. Phase 1 will be what I have identified as a minimum viable product. Please find below the plans I have for each phase.

### Phase 1
- Allow users to register for an account
- Responsive design
- Ability to create an appointment
- Ability to update a appointment
- Ability to cancel a appointment

### Phase 2
- Contact form model, so messages are saved to the database

<a name="structure"></a>

## 1.2. Structure

[Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

It is really important to include responsive design in this project as many users are using different devices (mobile, tablet, laptop/PC). This gives the user the best experience on their device.

- Responsive on all device sizes
- Easy navigation through labelled buttons
- Footer at the bottom of the index page that links to the social media website.
- All elements will be consistent including font size, font family, colour scheme.

### Database Model
Planned database structure:
![database_model](documentation_assets/images/database_model.png)

Final database structure:

```python
class Booking(models.Model):
    booking_id = models.UUIDField(
        primary_key=True, default=uuid.uuid4, editable=False)
    user = models.ForeignKey(
        User, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name="user_bookings")
    booking_date = models.DateField(auto_now=False)
    booking_time = models.TimeField(auto_now=False)
    booking_comments = models.TextField(max_length=200, blank=True)
    created_on = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    guest_count = models.IntegerField()
    status = models.IntegerField(choices=STATUS, default=0)

    class Meta:
        ordering = ['-booking_date']


class UserProfile(models.Model):
    user = models.OneToOneField(
        User, on_delete=models.CASCADE, primary_key=True)
    first_name = models.CharField(max_length=150)
    last_name = models.CharField(max_length=150)
    phone_number = models.CharField(max_length=11)

    def __str__(self):
        return str(self.user)
```

### Colours

Please find the colours schemes that I used [here](https://coolors.co/bd3c31-000000-ffffff-212529).

### Typography

I decided to use Be Vietnam Pro as my font of choice with sans serif as my backup font for browsers that might not support Be Vietnam Pro.

The link to the font can be found [here](https://fonts.google.com/share?selection.family=Be%20Vietnam%20Pro).

# 2. Features

[Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

### All Pages
- The navigation bar is placed at the top of all pages. The navigation bar is dynamic in that meaning depending on if the user is logged in or not the options will change.
- If the user is not logged in the navigation bar will look like this:
![user_not_logged_in](documentation_assets/images/navbar_not_logged_in.png)
- If the user is logged in the navigation bar will look like this:
![user_logged_in](documentation_assets/images/navbar_logged_in.png)
- The footer is placed at the bottom of each page with social media icons. When hovering over them it creates a zoom effect giving the user more of an experience. These icons will open the links in a new tab.

- The restaurant logo is also placed at the top of all pages. Clicking on it will also direct the user to the home page.
- Animated background, to give more of a user experience instead of a plain static background.

### Register Page
- A simple signup form that requires the user to enter a unique email address and a password. The password must be entered again for confirmation, this must match the already entered password above.
- A message to prompt the user that if an account is already been created they can click the sign-in hyperlink to be redirected to the sign-in page.
- If the user enters an email address that has already been registered, the user is prompted by an error message.
![email_validation_error](documentation_assets/images/signup_email_validation.png)
- If the user enters a password that is not secure, the user will be prompted by a message.
![password_too_common](documentation_assets/images/password_too_common.png)
- If the user enters both passwords that do not match, the user is prompted by a message.
![signup_email_validation](documentation_assets/images/signup_email_validation.png)
- Once the user has successfully signed up, this will automatically log in and direct the user to the create profile page.

### Login Page
- A login form that requires the user to enter their email address and password that they used when signing up to the site.
- A message to prompt the user that if an account has not been created they can click the signup hyperlink to be redirected to the signup page.
- If the user enters in the wrong credentials, a message is displayed to the user.
![signup_email_validation](documentation_assets/images/login_validation.png)

### Logout Page
- When clicking logout from the navigation bar, the user is redirected to a sign-out page to confirm their action.

### Landing Page
- A simple but elegant banner to give the user a sense of the restaurant.
- A book now button that directs the user to create a booking page. If the user has not logged in it will prompt the user to register or log in first.
- A short introduction to describe the restaurant.

### Create Profile Page
- Once the user has registered they will be redirected to the create profile page. The page displays a form for the user to enter their first name, last name and telephone number.

### Edit Profile Page
- The user can navigate to this page by clicking on the edit profile link in the navigation bar. This page will display the current profile details with a form below for the user to update any details.

### Menu Page
- The restaurant opening times are displayed at the top of the page.
- A menu that is displayed in 3 sections by the food category.

### Contact Page
- An information section that displays the restaurant telephone number, email address, opening times and address.
- A contact form that requires the user to enter their full name, email address and a message. The form is already pre-filled with the user's full name (if the user is logged in and has created a profile).
- A Google maps iframe of the restaurant location.

### Create Booking Page
- A form that requires the user to enter/select the booking details.
Full name and contact telephone number are prefilled if the user has created a profile.
The user will then need to select a date, time, number of guests and enter any allergy information if needed.
- The date input field has JavaScript code so the default value is today's date and the user cannot select a date that is previous to today.
- When clicking the make reservation button the booking will then be requested to the restaurant owner for approval.
- As the restaurant is only open from 2 PM, if the user selects a time before that, the form will display an error, prompting the customer to select a later time.
![booking_time_error](documentation_assets/images/booking_time_error.png)

### Manage Booking Page
- Displays all user-related bookings in a list view within a card.
- Each card will show a booking reference, booking status, booking date, booking time, guest count. It will also contain a button to change booking details and a cancel booking button.

### Edit Booking Page
- This page will display the current booking details with a form below for the user to update any details.
- When the changes are submitted, the booking will be processed as the booking requested status.

# 4. Testing

[Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

### Google Developer Tools
For every element that I added to my HTML, I would add the basic CSS to my stylesheet. I would then use the inspect element to try different styles. Once I've got it to my liking I would try to see if I can implement the styling with bootstrap, if I could not replicate the styling I would copy the CSS from google and paste it into my CSS stylesheet. This allows me to keep track of the code I am using.

I also checked the accessibility of the page using lighthouse.
![google_lighthouse](documentation_assets/images/google_lighthouse.png)

### Responsive Tools
I used [Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is) to make sure that all my pages are responsive to all devices.

### W3C Validator Tools
#### HTML:
I used [W3C Markup](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input+with_options) to check for any errors within the HTML pages.

I had an error on the base.html template:
![base.html_error](documentation_assets/images/base.html_error.png)

This was then rectified by adding the lang attribute to the current HTML tag and deleting the other one.
![base.html_fix](documentation_assets/images/base.html_fix.png)

I had an error on the contact.html template:
![contact.html_error](documentation_assets/images/contact.html_error.png)

This was then rectified by removing the width styling of 100% and replacing it with a class="w-100".
![contact.html_fix](documentation_assets/images/contact.html_fix.png)

#### CSS:
I used [W3C CSS Validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to check for any errors within my CSS stylesheet.

I had no errors in my CSS file:
![css_validation](documentation_assets/images/css_validation.png)

### JavaScript:
I used [JS Hint](https://jshint.com/) to check for any errors within my JavaScript script tags. JS Hint showed warnings on line 1 which was missing a semicolon, however as this was for the script tag I have ignored it. This piece of JavaScript was along copied and pasted from an external source therefore, I have not made any changes to the code.

I had no errors in my JavaScript files:
![javascript_validation](documentation_assets/images/javascript_validation.png)

### Python:
I used [PEP8 online](http://pep8online.com/) to check for any errors within my Python files. The validator showed multiple "line too long" errors. This was rectified by adding each statement as a new line.

urls.py errors:
![urls_errors](documentation_assets/images/urls_errors.png)

Fixed urls.py validation:
![urls_fixed_errors](documentation_assets/images/urls_fixed_errors.png)

There were also "line too long" errors within my settings.py file but I have chosen to ignore these as this is a very important file.

settings.py errors:
![settings_errors](documentation_assets/images/settings_errors.png)

# 6. Deployment

[Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

I used the terminal to deploy my project locally. To do this I had to:
1. Create a repository on GitHub.
2. Clone the repository on your chosen source code editor (GitPod in my case) using the clone link.
3. Open the terminal within GitPod
4. Enter "python3 manage.py runserver into the terminal.
5. Go to local host address on my web browser.
6. All locally saved changes will show up here.

For the final deployment to Heroku, I had to:
1. Uncomment the PostgreSQL databse from my settings.py file.
2. Set debug = False in my settings.py file.
3. Commit and push all files to GitHub
3. In Heroku, remove the DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC config var.
4. In the deploy tab, go to the manual deploy sections and click deploy branch.

I had an issue with the deployed site and the CSS was not showing on my screen.
This was rectified by restarting all dynos in Heroku.

# 8. Known Bugs

[Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

- Some items in the navigation bar don't have a is active red background to show the user they are on the selected page.

- Some forms for this project is built by using the django-crispy-forms libraries therefore, some of the fields do not contain all the validation rules as I cannot target the individual inputs. For example on the edit profile form, I have add the validation rule so that the user can only enter a number, however I couldnt not figure out a way to add a min and max length value.
